I'm a driven software engineer known for thriving in high-pressure scenarios. My quick learning ability, coupled with effective communication skills, distinguishes me. Proficient in technologies like JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, Flask, Express, Sequelize, SQLalchemy, Material UI, AWS, Auth0, and API integration, I excel in both front-end and back-end development.
